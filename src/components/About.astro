          I’m a Human-centered Designer, driven by curiosity, passionate about the power that technology has to impact lives.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          I have been in the IT industry since 2012 and worked in areas such as infrastructure, CS and software development,
          until arriving at UX Design, where I find fulfillment. All of this enables me to have a holistic vision,
          full of empathy and technical knowledge to integrate coherent solutions.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          My strong foundation in agile methodologies allows me to plan the design process efficiently, ensuring accurate
          and valuable deliverables for both users and the business.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          Currently, I’m specializing in metrics and data-driven solutions, combining them with behavioral analytics
          to create solutions that challenge the status quo and have a true purpose.
