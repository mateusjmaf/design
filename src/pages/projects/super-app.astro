      <p class="mb-4">
        We merged the experience of four backoffice mobile applications into a single, more intuitive solution focused on three user profiles.
        The new app simplified several business management flows, in addition to including a Notifications area to monitor processes and product
        news, and new features to make use more efficient.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        By mapping journeys, we consolidate each of the workflows contained in the applications, creating a clear and consistent information
        architecture, with a focus on facilitating navigation and integrating relevant notifications.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The solution resulted in a cohesive and efficient experience, bringing more security to processes and simplifying user decision-making.

        <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Challenge</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Initially, we were given the mission of unifying all the experiences contained in the journeys of 4 mobile applications for the backoffice
          segment, namely: <span class="font-bold">Meus Ativos, Meus Contratos, Meu Protheus</span> and <span class="font-bold">Meu Desconto INSS,</span>
          which encompass workflows related to Requests, Approvals, Data Views, Indicators and Asset Movements.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The biggest challenge was to merge all these diffuse and divergent experiences, in order to facilitate users routines, considering the
          profiles of Requesters, Analysts and Managers.

          <li class="mb-2"><span class="font-bold">Notifications:</span> to inform users about the progress of their processes in the App;</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><span class="font-bold">Branch toggle:</span> to make this action easier and more intuitive, without the need to login again.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">Approach</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          This project was executed by me and two other designers, one being a Usability Specialist who managed the execution, and another third-party
          analyst who carried out the hands-on with me in the steps that I will explain below.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          We started the project by getting a general understanding of each of the applications by mapping the user journey in each workflow. At this stage,
          we used a lot of internal documentation from the development teams and customer support to quickly put together a diagram, but it was still
          difficult to understand the nuances of these flows.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          So I suggested we do a <span class="font-bold">User Experience Mapping</span> using a technique I had used to structure two other successful ERP
          tool redesign projects, similar to a sitemap but using the application interfaces themselves, making it easier to understand each workflow,
          interactions and start to identify patterns and inconsistencies:
        </p>

            class="w-full rounded-sm"
          />
        </div>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Subsequently, we reviewed this mapping material with the project's core team, made up of technical and business people with know-how on each of the applications.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          With this, we clarified each touchpoint of the workflows and understood how these applications relate to each other, making crucial discoveries of
          functionalities that were even, ironically, considered an “easter egg” due to inconsistency in usability.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          After analyzing the material in more depth with due understanding, we were able to identify the following patterns among the applications:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
          <li class="mb-2">Actions for requests with pending status;</li>
          <li class="mb-2">History of requests with approved and rejected status;</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Filters for requests.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, we also identified some inconsistencies between the apps’ experiences, such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
          <li class="mb-2">Different information architecture for each application;</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Actionable elements, such as cards and buttons with different behaviors;</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Divergent navigation pattern and interface;</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Writing in general, especially on action labels using different terms for the same type of action.</li>
        </ul>
        <img 
          src="/design/projects/super-app/apps-divergence.jpg"
          alt="TO DO ! TO DO ! TO DO ! TO DO !"
          class="w-full rounded-sm mb-6"
        />
        <blockquote class="p-4 mb-4 border-s-4 dark:border-gray-500 dark:bg-gray-800">
          <p>
            An <span class="font-bold">extremely important</span> point, was identifying that the <span class="font-bold">Meu INSS</span>
            app was disconnected from the others and could cause confusion. We explained this to the project sponsor based on the mapping
            we carried out and obtained permission to remove it from the scope.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Based on these lessons learned, we began to design a new and unique mental model focused on unifying these experiences, but
          also minimally maintaining the current functioning of the business rules of the other applications.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          We structured this information architecture in a mental map without designing the interface itself, focusing on terms such
          as navigation, actions and data listing, which made it possible to organize and iterate in a much more agile and efficient
          way as the idea matured.
        </p>

          alt="TO DO ! TO DO ! TO DO ! TO DO !"
          class="w-full rounded-sm mb-6"
        />
        <p class="mb-4">
          Soon after consolidating this architecture, we began designing some interface models with a low-fidelity prototype.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          This stage was crucial to seek solutions in a creative and collaborative way, involving both the usability specialist
          to refine the proposals, and the core team itself in checkpoints to assess the technical feasibility of the solution.
        </p>
        <img 
          src="/design/projects/super-app/prototype-low-fidelity-home.jpg" 
          alt="TO DO ! TO DO ! TO DO ! TO DO !"
          class="w-full rounded-sm mb-6"
        />
        <p class="mb-4">
          To achieve this, we took into account some design assumptions for this new model to create the Non-logged-in Area,
          Configuration Wizard Shortcut, Notifications, Branch Toggle, as detailed in the 
          <a href="#challenge" class="links">Challenge</a> section.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          In addition to the premises, we also brought additional concepts with insights obtained during the mapping of
          journeys for a better experience with the products unified in the new proposal:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2"><span class="font-bold">Overview:</span> emphasized the number of Requests with pending status for each
            workflow to help manage these demands, which are the core of the application;</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><span class="font-bold">Information summary:</span> highlighted the main information in a consolidated
            manner to assist in decision-making for each workflow;</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><span class="font-bold">Quick navigation:</span> in addition to a toolbar for instant access to Notifications
            and Branch Change with global access in the application, a quick-filter was implemented in the Information Summary.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-4">
          After a few sessions, we converged these ideas and began designing the medium-fidelity prototype, adding the appropriate
          interactions to carry out the usability test.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          With these characteristics, we achieved consistency and simplicity in general, creating an easy-to-understand information
          architecture with only 3 navigation levels and the same Mental Model for each workflow, namely: 1) the Home Page, 2) the
          Context, 3) and Context details.

        </div>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Once the mid-fidelity prototype was developed, we began usability testing to efficiently and cost-effectively validate the
          solution created.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          To this end, we have developed a script with some real scenarios to clarify tasks related to the Contract Management,
          Purchase Orders, Accounting and Asset Management workflows.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          It is worth mentioning that for the Home Page, we designed some models that translated the summarized information into different
          views, and we sought to understand which would work best for users during validations with an A/B “plus” preference test.

          <p>
            In total, there were 13 rounds of usability testing where we took notes of all the observations made by users, and then
            consolidated everything for a later analysis together with the project's core team.

        <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4">Learnings</h4>
        <p class="mb-4">
          With the inputs generated from the test analysis, we were able to better understand some user behaviors and preferences, which
          made it possible to iterate on the flows and make them even leaner and more simplified. Below is a highlight of these iterations:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li class="mb-2"><span class="font-bold">Navigation:</span> the position of the application's back button has been changed, reusing
            the users' mental model on mobile devices, expanding the space for content on the screen and making navigation more intuitive;</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><span class="font-bold">Filters:</span> eliminated “quick filter” options on context pages as they conflicted with
            the understanding of the Filter action, thus also making the interface cleaner;</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><span class="font-bold">Filter parameters:</span> another necessary change in the filters was the marking of the
            selected parameters on the screen, to show whether they were applied, which also allows for the quick removal of applied parameters
            when viewing the data;</li>
          <li class="mb-2"><span class="font-bold">Asset Flow:</span> in this journey, a pre-existing visualization mode of the original “Moviment
            History” was also improved after realizing that this caused confusion, we relocated it to the 3rd navigation level (Context Details)

          <li class="mb-2"><span class="font-bold">Key Info:</span> new information has also been added to the data index listed after users
