      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Overview</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We merged the experience of four backoffice mobile applications into a single, more intuitive solution focused on three user profiles.
        The new app simplified several business management flows, in addition to including a Notifications area to monitor processes and product
        news, and new features to make use more efficient.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        By mapping journeys, we consolidate each of the workflows contained in the applications, creating a clear and consistent information
        architecture, with a focus on facilitating navigation and integrating relevant notifications.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The solution resulted in a cohesive and efficient experience, bringing more security to processes and simplifying user decision-making.

        <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Challenge</h3>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Initially, we were given the mission of unifying all the experiences contained in the journeys of 4 mobile applications for the backoffice
          segment, namely: <span class="font-bold">Meus Ativos, Meus Contratos, Meu Protheus</span> and <span class="font-bold">Meu Desconto INSS,</span>
          which encompass workflows related to Requests, Approvals, Data Views, Indicators and Asset Movements.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The biggest challenge was to merge all these diffuse and divergent experiences, in order to facilitate users routines, considering the
          profiles of Requesters, Analysts and Managers.
