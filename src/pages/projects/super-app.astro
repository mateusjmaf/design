      <p class="mb-4">
        We unified the experience of four backoffice mobile applications into a single, more intuitive solution focused on three user profiles.
        The new app simplified several business management flows, in addition to including a Notifications area to monitor processes and product
        news, and new features to make use more efficient.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        By mapping journeys, we consolidate each of the workflows contained in the applications, creating a clear and consistent information
        architecture, with a focus on facilitating navigation and integrating relevant notifications.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The solution resulted in a cohesive and efficient experience, bringing more security to processes and simplifying user decision-making.
