      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Overview</h2>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Companies faced significant challenges with the complexity and lack of clarity in system interfaces, which resulted in dissatisfaction,
        friction in usage, and negative impacts on user experience. Additionally, system administrators dealt with lengthy and risky processes,
        making it difficult to efficiently manage routine customizations.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        To address these challenges, I led a collaborative project based on human-centered approaches, involving in-depth research with stakeholders,
        synthesis and ideation activities, as well as multiple iterations of prototypes and testing. The result was an innovative solution: a wizard-style
        interface that simplifies tasks into just three intuitive steps, reducing complexity and fostering greater user confidence.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Briefing</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
          The system's modules are very broad, as they aim to meet the needs of businesses of various sizes,
          making them complex in certain contexts and causing dissatisfaction with the products.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          This complexity sometimes affects users' cognitive load and increases friction in usage, making it more
          burdensome to fill out fields that truly matter. Additionally, it impacts the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)
          by affecting the user experience due to delays in the interface's loading time.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8">
          This situation also affects the system administrators, who manage the tool's usage within companies and are
          tasked with revising these interfaces in a sustainable manner to maintain the ERP's proper functionality.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Process</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Together with two other researchers, we started the project with a well-grounded research phase, seeking to raise
          doubts (CSD Matrix) to be explored with key users and extract all expertise from the core team, which consisted of
          six product specialists, most of whom had nearly three decades of experience in the field.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          We conducted a total of 12 in-depth interviews to understand the needs and challenges system administrators face in
          their daily operations‚Äîfrom receiving user requests to implementing the requested changes. We found that the process
          was slow and risky to execute.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Afterward, we synthesized all research findings with the core team using the following sequence of activities: Affinity Mapping,
          Insight Generation, and HMW (How Might We). Through this, we determined that some needs could be addressed with the support of
          intelligent technologies for impact analysis and a well-defined step-by-step process with clear metadata information.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-8">
          The dots began to be connected. We then conducted a brainwriting session to ideate a solution based on the research synthesis, which
          served as a guiding principle in prototyping a tool to assist users throughout the process. This tool created a mental model with clear
          steps and information to support decision-making.
        </p>
        <img 
          src="/design/projects/screen-optimizer/prototype-low-fidelity.png" 
          alt="Otimiza√ß√£o de Formul√°rios"
          class="w-full rounded-lg mb-8"
        />
        <p class="mb-2">
          The key point here was the inclusion of functionality within these steps to analyze and scan unused fields to be executed in the client's
          database. This needed to be made very clear. So, we built a low-fidelity prototype (Miro) and validated the concept with another group of
          recruited users.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          At this point, I fully took over the project, starting with the review and analysis of insights gained from the initial validation. I added
          functionalities and workflows that were not previously considered, such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Including an editing flow ‚Äì emphasizing the need for user freedom and control;</li>
          <li>Eliminating redundancy in customization creation steps ‚Äì to simplify and make the process intuitive;</li>
          <li>Adding additional information about routines ‚Äì to facilitate decision-making;</li>
          <li>Improving text and labels overall ‚Äì to clarify the steps and required actions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-8">
          Once this phase was consolidated and the prototype had been iterated to medium fidelity (Axure RP), I decided to open the project to a design
          critique session. I invited eight designers without project context biases to evaluate some usability-related technical issues.
        </p>
        <img 
          src="/design/projects/screen-optimizer/prototype-mid-fidelity.png" 
          alt="Otimiza√ß√£o de Formul√°rios"
          class="w-full rounded-lg mb-8"
        />
        <p class="mb-2">
          After this brief refinement, I conducted usability tests with 13 key product users, focusing on the tool's usability. This new validation round
          provided more insights for improving writing, as some actions were still unclear during the first use. Additionally, we added new information to
          the data visualization to help users analyze and customize routines.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          During this phase, I also conducted A/B tests during the usability tests to understand user preferences regarding the display mode of certain
          information in the analysis step, questioning them about tasks within this context.
        </p>


        <blockquote class="p-4 mb-4 border-s-4 dark:border-gray-500 dark:bg-gray-800">
          <p>
            Although the model designed in the prototype worked, users preferred the second option, which offered even greater clarity of information.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="mb-2">
          After completing the usability phase, I added comments to the prototype with all highlights transcribed during the tests, making it easier for the
          core team to analyze and prioritize each point. This provided valuable insights to improve the tool's functionality, making it more intuitive and
          efficient, such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Removing the search feature when no data is available ‚Äì to avoid confusion and make the tool more intuitive.</li>
          <li>Changing the location of the customization deletion action ‚Äì to reduce clicks required for the action.</li>
          <li>Adding new data to the analysis table ‚Äì which users considered important for evaluating the impact of customization.</li>
          <li>Improving the title of step 3 and the customization confirmation message text ‚Äì to make the final customization step more cohesive.</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote class="p-4 mb-8 border-s-4 dark:border-gray-500 dark:bg-gray-800">
          <p>
            Seven additional improvement opportunities were identified but were not included in this MVP of the tool. They were documented for the
            development team's technical feasibility study.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Solution</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Finally, I consolidated all the learnings gathered during the process into the project. I designed an interface based on a wizard that divides
          the task into just three manageable and intuitive steps. This resulted in a significant reduction in configuration time due to a simplified and
          intuitive workflow, promoting greater confidence through the use of technologies that enable prescriptive analysis and assist users in decision-making.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          The tool's journey begins on a page for managing the system's routine customizations. Here, the user can later manipulate each customization with actions
          like editing, deleting, or even disabling it:
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
          Continuing the journey, the user can create a new customization or edit an existing one, following the same step-by-step process:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-8">
          <li>Description and Routine: The user selects the routine to modify and creates personal IDs for its management.</li>
          <li>Field Analysis and Removal: The user executes the database analysis (if desired) and configures the customization.</li>
          <li>Template Review: Finally, the user reviews all definitions to ensure correctness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Key Results</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
          At the end of the project, I analyzed the data obtained throughout the usability cycle, noting the following metrics:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Success Rate: Achieved a total of 94.62% task effectiveness.</li>
          <li>NPS: Reached 76.92%, with 11 of 13 users being promoters and an average rating of 9.4.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-8">
          I also defined metrics using the HEART framework, but I will not address them here to maintain confidentiality regarding strategic aspects of the field.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Client Testimonials</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">
          In total, approximately 90 people were involved during the design thinking approach, including companies like Mitsubishi Electric, John Deere, and AMG Motors.
        </p>
