      <h3 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Overview</h3>
      <p class="mb-2">
        Customers faced significant challenges such as complexity and lack of clarity in system interfaces, which resulted in dissatisfaction,
        friction in use and negative impacts on the user experience. In addition, system administrators in companies, when requested, spent a
        lot of time on complex and risky processes, making adjustments to these routines.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        To break down these barriers, we carried out a collaborative project based on human-centered approaches, involving in-depth user research,
        synthesis and ideation dynamics, as well as multiple iterations of prototypes and testing.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The result was an innovative solution: <span class="font-bold">a tool for custom fit interfaces in ERP routines</span>,
        with a more efficient process aided by technology and a wizard format that simplifies the task in just three intuitive steps.

        <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Briefing</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">
          The system's routines are very broad, as they aim to serve different business sizes, becoming complex and
          tardy in some contexts, which generates low user satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          This complexity sometimes ends up affecting users' cognitive load and generating more friction in use, burdening the completion of 
          tasks that really matter, in addition to impacting the TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) by affecting the user experience with delays
          in loading the interface.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-8">
          All of this also ends up affecting system administrators, who manage ERP in companies and are compelled to modify these interfaces
          in a sustainable way to maintain the correct functioning of the system as a whole
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Process</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Together with two other researchers, we started the project with a well-grounded research phase, seeking to raise
          doubts (CSD Matrix) to be explored with key users and extract all expertise from the core team, which consisted of
          six product specialists, most of whom had nearly three decades of experience in the field.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          We then conducted a total of 12 in-depth interviews to understand the needs and challenges that users and system administrators had in
          their day-to-day lives when carrying out this type of operation, from the emergence of this demand to the implementation of the changes,
          and we identified that it was a slow and risky process to carry out.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          Thereafter, we synthesized all the research with the core team using the following sequence of dynamics: Affinity grouping, Insight generation
          and HMW. In this way, we found that the most aggravating need was to analyze the impact of the change in metadata and a non-standardized process.
          The dots began to be connected.
        </p>
        <img 
          src="/design/projects/interface-optimizer/synthesize-inputs.png" 
          alt="A board with a synthesizing inputs, with a lot of post its."
          class="w-full rounded-md mb-6"
        />
        <p class="mb-2">
          Then, we carried out the Brainwriting dynamic to generate ideas based on the synthesized material, which served as a basis for prototyping a
          solution that would assist users throughout the customization process, creating a mental model with clear steps and information that would
          contribute to decision-making.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          The key point here was the inclusion of an intelligent functionality within these steps, which would perform a check for unused fields in
          the customer base. This needed to be very clear.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          With that, we built a low-end prototype <a href="https://miro.com/" target="_blank" class="font-medium text-blue-600 underline dark:text-teal-200
          hover:no-underline">(Miro)</a> and validated the concept with another group of recruited users:
        </p>
        <img 
          src="/design/projects/interface-optimizer/prototype-low-fidelity.png" 
          alt="Otimiza√ß√£o de Formul√°rios"
          class="w-full rounded-md mb-6"
        />
        <p class="mb-2">
          From this moment on, I took over the management of the project, starting with the analysis and prioritization of the lessons learned in
          the first validation. This made it possible to iterate the prototype with functionalities and flows not previously mapped, such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Inclusion of an editing workflow ‚Äì as I emphasized the need for freedom and control for users;</li>
          <li>Elimination of redundancy in steps when creating customization ‚Äì to simplify and make the process more intuitive;</li>
          <li>Need for additional information about routines ‚Äì to facilitate decision-making;</li>
          <li>Application of improvements to texts and labels in general ‚Äì to provide more clarity on the necessary steps and actions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-6">
          With the approval of stakeholders, I consolidated this stage by iterating the prototype into a medium-fidelity version <a href="https://www.axure.com/"
          target="_blank" class="font-medium text-blue-600 underline dark:text-teal-200 hover:no-underline">(Axure RP)</a> and invited around 8
          designers from other product areas to carry out a Design Critique dynamic, in order to bring a perspective without the bias of context
          for evaluating technical usability issues.
        </p>
        <img 
          src="/design/projects/interface-optimizer/prototype-mid-fidelity.png" 
          alt="A sample of the mid fidelity prototype, showing the step 2 of the tool."
          class="w-full rounded-md mb-6"
        />
        <p class="mb-2">
          After this brief refinement, I conducted usability tests with 13 key product users, now emphasizing on the tool's usability. This new validation round
          provided more insights for improving writing, as some actions were still not clear enough on first access. Additionally, I also added new information
          in the data visualization to help users analyze and customize their routines.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6">
          During the usability test, I also applied A/B tests to understand user preferences regarding two structures designed to display information in the
          analysis stage of the customization routine.
        </p>
        <img 
          src="/design/projects/interface-optimizer/ab-test.png" 
          alt="The A/B test showed to user during de usability test, representing the metadata visualization."
          class="w-full rounded-md mb-6"
        />
        <blockquote class="p-4 mb-4 border-s-4 dark:border-gray-500 dark:bg-gray-800">
          <p>
            Although the designed structure worked, users ended up preferring the second option, which would provide an even better understanding of the
            information due to a preconceived mental model of the system itself.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="mb-2">
          To complete the usability cycle, I added comments to the prototype containing all the highlights from the transcriptions made during the usability
          tests, and later facilitated a dynamic for analysis and prioritization with the main team on each of these points.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          With this, we were able to obtain some more valuable insights to improve the tool's operation and make it more intuitive and functional, such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Removed the search for customizations when they have not yet been created ‚Äì to avoid confusion and make the tool more intuitive;</li>
          <li>Changed the location of the customization deletion ‚Äì to make it easier to access the action;</li>
          <li>Added new information to the analysis table ‚Äì to help assess the importance of the element;</li>
          <li>Improved the title of the last step of the process and in the completion message ‚Äì to make the final customization step more cohesive.</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote class="p-4 mb-8 border-s-4 dark:border-gray-500 dark:bg-gray-800">
          <p>
            Another 7 improvement opportunities were also identified that did not fit into this tool's MVP, but were documented for technical feasibility
            study by the development team.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Solution</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Finally, I consolidated all the learnings gathered during the process into the project. I designed an interface based on a wizard that divides
          the task into just three manageable and intuitive steps. This resulted in a significant reduction in configuration time due to a simplified and
          intuitive workflow, promoting greater confidence through the use of technologies that enable prescriptive analysis and assist users in decision-making.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2">
          The tool's journey begins on a page for managing the system's routine customizations. Here, the user can later manipulate each customization with actions
          like editing, deleting, or even disabling it:
        </p>
        <img 
          src="/design/projects/interface-optimizer/protype-high-fidelity-home.png" 
          alt="Otimiza√ß√£o de Formul√°rios"
          class="w-full rounded-md mb-8"
        />
        <p class="mb-4">
          Continuing the journey, the user can create a new customization or edit an existing one, following the same step-by-step process:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-8">
          <li>Description and Routine: The user selects the routine to modify and creates personal IDs for its management.</li>
          <li>Field Analysis and Removal: The user executes the database analysis (if desired) and configures the customization.</li>
          <li>Template Review: Finally, the user reviews all definitions to ensure correctness.</li>
        </ul>
        <img 
          src="/design/projects/interface-optimizer/protype-high-fidelity-stepper.png" 
          alt="Otimiza√ß√£o de Formul√°rios"
          class="w-full rounded-md mb-8"
        />
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Key Results</h2>
        <p class="mb-2">
          At the end of the project, I analyzed the data obtained throughout the usability cycle, noting the following metrics:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Success Rate: Achieved a total of 94.62% task effectiveness.</li>
          <li>NPS: Reached 76.92%, with 11 of 13 users being promoters and an average rating of 9.4.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mb-8">
          I also defined metrics using the HEART framework, but I will not address them here to maintain confidentiality regarding strategic aspects of the field.
        </p>
